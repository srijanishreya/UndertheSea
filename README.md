# UndertheSea
I developed a 2D scuba diving game using Python's Processing library. Players navigate an underwater maze, avoiding sharks and collecting treasure chests across multiple levels. Each level increases in difficulty with faster-moving obstacles. The game features real-time obstacle movement, collision detection, and dynamic level transitions.
